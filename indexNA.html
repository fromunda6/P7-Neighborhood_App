<!-- TODO, more specific than in-app proj.req's

  b. per separation of concerns, create listView,mapView,model,viewModel(formerly known as controller) code sections.
  c. for 'severe/impressive' detail on list/searching functionality, please see "Understanding API Services parts 20-21"
  d. for each API req, encapsulate in jquery.ajax() method
  e. tend to CSS(responsive design)
  f. ID potential app failures and implement contingency behavior, could be as simple as(although 'status' is only geocode-recognized):
  else {
        alert('Geocode was not successful for the following reason: ' + status);
          }-->
